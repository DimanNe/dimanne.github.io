title: Grammar Part I

# **Grammar Part I**

## **Infinitive**

### Functions of the Zero Infinitive

##### The zero infinitive after verbs of perception.

With verbs of perception, the pattern is _verb + object + zero infinitive_:

* He **saw her fall** from the cliff.
* We **heard them close** the door.
* They **saw us walk** toward the lake.
* She **felt the spider crawl up** her leg.

##### The zero infinitive after the verbs make and let

##### The zero infinitive with _why_

The question word _why_ is followed by the zero infinitive when making suggestions:

* **Why wait** until tomorrow?
* **Why not ask** him now?
* **Why leave** before the end of the game?
* **Why walk** when we can go in the car?
* **Why not buy** a new bed?

### "Tenses" of infinitive --- [[1](https://test-english.com/explanation/b2/gerunds-infinitives-complex-forms/)]

##### Simple Infinitive --- [[1](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/)], [[2](https://www.engvid.com/active-and-passive-infinitives/)].

Active Voice:

* She plans to invite them.
* Mike is afraid to make mistakes.

Passive Voice.

It is particularly common after auxiliary verbs (_may_, _should_, _could_, etc.) to indicate what is
possible or what is correct. The passive infinitive is formed: _to be + past participle_.

* They **expect to be invited**.
* I am **expecting to be given** a pay-rise next month.
* She is **hoping to be elected** president.
* The carpet **needs to be washed**.
* These doors should be shut at night.
* This window may be opened but that one must stay closed.


##### Continuous infinitive --- [[1](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/)].

The continuous infinitive is used to express a continuing action after a verb or auxiliary which must be
followed by the infinitive. The continuous infinitive is formed: _to be + present participle_.

As with the present infinitive, there are situations where the zero form of the continuous infinitive is
required, so the word _to_ is omitted. This happens after most modal auxiliaries, and in other places where
zero infinitives are used:

* I'd really **like to be swimming** in a nice cool pool right now.
* I **happened to be waiting** for the bus when the accident happened.
* It must be **nice to be going to a** wedding overseas.
* You **must be joking**!
* We **should be hurrying**. We're late! (See Modal Verbs below)
* You'd **better be working on** your report when I get there.


##### Perfect Infinitive --- [[1](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/)], [[2](https://www.engvid.com/active-and-passive-infinitives/)].

Active Voice.

The perfect infinitive is most commonly found in type 3 conditional sentences as part of the conditional
perfect, although it can be used in other places as well. The perfect infinitive is formed: _to have +
past participle_. As with the present infinitive, there are situations where the zero form of the
perfect infinitive is required:

* He **pretended to have seen** the film.
* Before I turn 40, **I want to have written** a book.
* **I would like to have been to the** Taj Mahal when I was in India.
* If I had known you were coming I would have baked a cake. (See Modal Verbs below)
* Someone must have broken the window and climbed in. (See Modal Verbs below)
* That man may have noticed the bank robbers' getaway car. (See Modal Verbs below)

Passive Voice.

* I am **happy to have been invited**.
* I **was on honour to have been chosen for** the award.


##### Perfect continuous infinitive --- [[1](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/)].

The perfect continuous infinitive is used to express a continuing but now completed action after a verb
which must be followed by the infinitive. The perfect infinitive is formed: _to have been +
present participle_. As with the present infinitive, there are situations where the zero form of the
perfect continuous infinitive is required:

* The **woman seemed to have been crying**.
* He **pretended to have been painting** all day.
* I **would have preferred to have been sleeping all** afternoon.
* You must have been waiting for hours! (See Modal Verbs below)
* They might have been talking before you came in. (See Modal Verbs below)
* You should have been studying for your test. (See Modal Verbs below)












## **_-ing_: Gerund & Present Participles**

### Present Participles --- [[1](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/)].

##### ... after verbs of perception

* We **saw him swimming** across the pond.
* I **watched her painting** Sarah's portrait.
* I **couldn't hear her singing** because of the noise.
* I **would like to see you knitting** sometime.

##### ...after verbs of movement, action or position

... to indicate parallel activities:

* **She sat looking** at the sea.
* **He walks reading** his newspaper.
* **I cook listening** to the radio.
* **Sally lay listening** to the bugs in the grass.

##### ... for two actions at the same time
When two actions occur at the same time, and are done by the same person or thing, we can use a present
participle to describe one of them. When one action follows very quickly after another done by the same
person or thing, we can express the first action with a present participle:

* **Whistling** to himself, he walked down the road. (He whistled to himself as he walked down the road)
* **They went laughing out** into the snow. (They laughed as they went out into the snow)
* **Dropping** the gun, she put her hands in the air. (She dropped the gun and put her hands in the air)
* **Putting on** his coat, he left the house (He put on his coat and left the house)

##### ... as adjectives

* Did you read that **amazing** book?
* This movie is so **exciting**!
* His economics class is **boring**.

##### ... with the verbs _spend_ and _waste_

* My boss spends two hours a day **travelling** to work.
* Don't **waste time playing** computer games!
* They've spent the whole day **shopping**.
* I wasted money **buying** this game.

##### ... with the verbs _catch_ and _find_

* If I **catch you stealing** my apples again, there'll be trouble!
* Don't let him **catch you reading** his letters.
* I **caught him going through** my bag.
* We **found some money lying** on the ground.
* They **found their mother sitting** in the garden.

##### ... to explain a reason

The present participle can be used instead of a phrase starting with _as_, _since_, or _because_.
In this usage the participial phrase explains the cause or reason for an action:

* **Feeling hungry**, he went into the kitchen and opened the fridge.
* **Being poor**, he didn't spend much on clothes.
* **Knowing that** his mother was coming, he cleaned the flat.
* He whispered, **thinking** his brother was still asleep.



### Complex Gerund

* The trouble is **his not having taken enough readings**.
* I know of **his (Peter's) using this method**.
* The possibility of **chemical energy being transformed into** electric energy is evident.
* The first **indication of there being such a particle** was given in his paper.
* Combustion was incomplete **due to insufficient oxygen being present**.


### Gerund --- [1](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/)
The gerund always has the same function as a noun, although it looks like a verb.
It can be used in the same way as a noun.

Usages of gerund after prepositions and certain specific verbs see below
in "_something followed by something rules_".

##### ... as the subject of the sentence

* **Eating** people is wrong.
* **Hunting** tigers is dangerous.
* **Flying** makes me nervous.
* **Brushing** your teeth is important.
* **Smoking** causes lung cancer.

##### ... as the compliment of the verb to be

* One of his duties is **attending** meetings.
* The hardest thing about learning English is **understanding** the gerund.
* One of life's pleasures is **having breakfast** in bed.

### Fifty shades of gerund. [[1](http://wordwizard.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=21154)], [[2](http://www.wordwizard.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=&p=47208#p47208)], [[3](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/96817/is-it-necessary-to-use-the-before-using-verb-ing-in-specific-contexts)], [[4](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/281046/gerund-with-and-without-of-preposition)]
The difference in the usage of gerunds and nouns is simple and obvious:

* gerunds must be used without articles and the preposition _of_: _I will start deleting the files_.
* whereas nouns require an article before and the preposition _of_ after: _I will start the deletion of the files_.

What is not obvious is when an _-ing_-ending word is a gerund or a noun.
Moreover, adding an article and the preposition often turns a gerund into deverbal noun:

* After I finish cleaning the bathroom I'm free to go.
* After I finish the cleaning of the bathroom I'm free to go.

To be precise, there is gradation of at least 15 elements between the deverbal noun
(e.g. _I own 17 paintings_) and the present participle in a finite verb phrase
(_I am painting the cat_). From Quirk & Greenbaum, A University Grammar of English:

1.  Some **paintings of** Brown's (ie some paintings that Brown owns)
2.  Brown's **paintings of** his daughter (ie paintings owned by Brown, depicting his daughter but painted by someone else)
3.  Brown's **paintings of** his daughter (ie they depict his daughter and were painted by him) 
4.  **The painting of** Brown is as skilful as that of Gainsborough (ie Brown's (a) technique of painting or (b) action of painting)
5.  Brown's deft **painting of** his daughter is a delight to watch (ie it is a delight to watch while Brown deftly paints his daughter)
6.  Brown's deftly **painting** his daughter is a delight to watch ( = [4b] and [5] in meaning)
7.  I dislike Brown's **painting** his daughter (ie I dislike either (a) the fact or (b) the way Brown docs it)
8.  I dislike Brown **painting** his daughter ( = [7a]) 
9.  I watched Brown **painting** his daughter (ie: either I watched Brown as he painted or I watched the process of Brown('s) painting his daughter)
10. Brown deftly **painting** his daughter is a delight to watch ( = [4b] and [5]) 
11. **Painting** his daughter, Brown noticed that his hand was shaking (ie while he was painting)
12. Brown **painting** his daughter that day, I decided to go for a walk (ie since Brown was painting) 
13. The man **painting** the girl is Brown (ie who is painting)
14. The silently **painting** man is Brown (ie who is silently painting)
15. He is **painting** his daughter

Examples 1, 2 and 3 are clearly deverbal nouns. 4 and 5, and possibly 6 are clearly what people would
normally call gerunds. 14 is what most people would call a gerundive and 15 is the plain old participle.
The rest, to me at least, is a grey area.



### Possessive Gerunds --- [[1](https://www.engvid.com/possessive-gerunds/)]

* I appreciate **your coming** here.
* He resents **Marry's being promoted**.
* I am tired **of Migel's complaining**.
* I need to talk to you about **your writing**.








## **Infinitive vs _-ing_: _having + past participle_ vs past participle**

### _having + past participle_ vs past participle

* Finished with the book, I had a holiday.
* Having finished the book, I had a holiday.


_**Seeing the red light ahead**, I slowed down_. Progressive participle describes something that the subject
of the sentence, (_I_), was doing at the time the sentence refers to.

_**Hating to walk**, she hailed a taxi_. In this case, hate is still a verb that applies at the time of
the main action.

_**Hated by everyone**, Bob didn't have anything to do on his birthday_. Here, the subject of the main
verb, _Bob_, **isn't doing** the verb in the participle phrase. Bob is described by the participle phrase.
It has passive meaning.

_Covered in yellow paint, the building cannot be missed_. Ditto here, _covered_ has a passive meaning,
and it applies at the time of the main action, in other words, it can be said in this way:
_The building is covered in yellow paint. The building cannot be missed_.

In your example above, you cannot say _I am finished the book_. However, you might say
_you are finished with the book_, so if you really want to use a past participle phrase, you could say:
_Finished with the book, I had a holiday_.

The second sentence in that example (above), it is a progressive participle phrase. You had finished the book.
This is essentially creating a progressive participle phrase out of a past or present perfect, and the tense
of the 'separated' version of that participle is set by the tense of the principal verb:

* Having finished the book, I had a holiday.
* I had finished the book. I had a holiday.

So, back to your first example. The first version is a perfect use of a perfect participle phrase:

* Faced with a bill for $10,000, he has taken an extra job.
* He is faced with a bill for $10,000. He has taken an extra job.

The second version introduces _having_ completely unnecessarily. If you really, really want to use _having_,
you need to find a way of putting where you can say _He has/had..._. The way to do that with the idea of
facing this bill would be:

* Having been faced with a bill for $10,000, he has taken an extra job.
* He has been faced with a bill for $10,000. He has taken an extra job.


### Resume. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle#Russian)

_-ing_:

* _Ving_: _Hating to walk, she..._ --- active, expresses the same tense (tense-less?) and refers to the same
  subject as in the main clause.
* _V3_: _Hated by everyone, Bob..._ --- passive, expresses the same tense (tense-less?) and refers to the
  same subject as in the main clause.
* _Having + V3_: _Having won every competition, he decided to retire._ --- active, expresses tense shifted
  back relative to the tense in the main clause, refers to the same subject as in the main clause.
* _Being + V3_: _The poem being read by the actor was written by my brother._ --- passive, expresses the
  same tense (tense-less?).
* _Having been + V3_: _Having been hunted close to extinction, the rhino is once again common in this area._ ---
  passive, tense shifted backward.

Infinitive:

* _She plans to invite them._ --- active, tense is unchanged.
* _He pretended to have seen the film._ --- active, tense shifted backward.
* _They expect to be invited._ --- passive, the same tense.
* _I am happy to have been invited._ --- passive, tense shifted backward.

and to ask for advice.

Uses2: Predictions and intentions. We use _shall_ instead of _will_ with _I_ and _we_ in rather formal
contexts to make predictions and to talk about intentions or decisions. It is much less common than _will_.

* **suggestion**: Shall I help you?

* **recommendation**: You ought to stop smoking. 
* **expected because he deserves it**: Jim ought to get the promotion.

* **advice against something** (notice there is no "to"): Mark ought not drink so much.

Present Positive: ought

Present Negative:

Future Negative:



##### Uses1
What is desired or ideal. We use ought to when talking about things which are desired or ideal:

* They ought to have more parks in the city centre.
* We ought to eat lots of fruit and vegetables every day.

We use _ought to have + V3_ form to talk about things that were desired or ideal in the past but which
didn’t happen. It can express regret:

* We ought to have locked the gate. Then the dog wouldn’t have got out. (The ideal or desired thing was that we locked the gate, but we didn’t.)
* I often think that I ought to have studied medicine not pharmacy. (I would be happier now if I had studied medicine.)

##### Uses2
What is likely. We can use ought to when we talk about what is likely or probable:

* The concert ought to only take about two hours so we’ll be home by 12 pm.
* There ought to be some good films at the cinema this weekend.

##### The negative
The negative is formed by adding ‘not’ after ought (ought not to). It can be contracted to oughtn’t to. The negative of ought to is not common. We usually use shouldn’t or should not instead.

##### Ought to or should?
Ought to and should are similar in meaning. Should is more common than ought to. Ought to is more formal than should:



### _to be to_. _to be to + have V3_

_to be to_ expresses arrangements, plans:

* We **are to** meet our friend at the station.
* The meeting **is to be held** tomorrow.
* They **were to meet** outside the cinema. (It is unknown whether they succeeded in meeting or not)

Use _to be to + have V3_ when previously scheduled plans were abandoned:
* They **were to have met** outside the cinema. (They did not meet)



### need
Need can also play a role of modal verb.

* You needn’t go into details
* You needn’t have waited for the manager, the secretary could have signed the papers



### Modal verbs' forms --- [[1](https://www.englishpage.com/modals/modalforms.html)], [[2](https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/elc/studyzone/410/grammar/410-modals-of-possibility-and-probability-with-continuous-tenses)], [[3](https://www.englishpage.net/showthread.php?19740-Should-verb-VS-should-be-verb-ing)], [[4](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/could-have-should-have-would-have.html)].
##### Simple
A fact is stated. No time is specified.

Active:

* I should clean the room once a day.
* I should go home.

Passive:

* The room should be cleaned once a day.


##### Continuous
We use modal verbs to make a guess or draw a logical conclusion about an activity in progress at the
present time (ie during the time of speaking).

The action should have already started or should right now start.

Active:

* I should be cleaning the room now.
* I should be going home.
* Person A: What’s all that noise?
* Person B: The neighbour’s son is in a rock band. They must be practicing.

Passive:

* The room should be being cleaned now.


##### Perfect
These past modal verbs are all used hypothetically, to talk about things that **didn't really happen in the past**.

Active:

* I should have cleaned the room yesterday.
* Julie could have bought the book, but she borrowed it from the library instead.

Some notes about would as modal verb.

Part of the third conditional:

* If I had had enough money, I would have bought a car (but I didn't have enough money, so I didn't buy a car).

Because _would_ (and _will_) can also be used to show if you want to do something or not (volition),
we can also use _would have + past participle_ to talk about something you wanted to do but didn't.
This is very similar to the third conditional, but we don't need an 'if clause':

* I would have called you, but I didn't know your number.
* A: Nobody volunteered to help us with the fair.
* B: I would have helped you. I didn't know you needed help.

Passive:

* The room should have been cleaned yesterday.


##### Perfect Continuous

Active:

* I should have been cleaning the room instead of watching TV.
* Person A: I didn’t hear a sound when I passed by the children’s room earlier.
* Person B: They must have been sleeping.

Passive:

* The room should have been being cleaned but nobody was there.
